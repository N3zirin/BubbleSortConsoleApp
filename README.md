This repository is created to code advanced versions of sorting algorithms in C# Programming Language.

1. First Project shows 'Bubble Sort'
*Bubble Sort Algorithm Overview*

The Bubble Sort algorithm is a straightforward method for sorting an array. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent pairs of elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement but is not efficient for large lists due to its O(n^2) time complexity. It is primarily useful for educational purposes and for small datasets.

2. Second Project shows 'Quick Sort'
*Quick Sort Algorithm Overview*

Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array. It begins by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two subarrays: those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. The pivot element is then placed in its correct position in the sorted array. The algorithm recursively applies the same process to the subarrays. This recursive partitioning and sorting continue until the base case of an array with zero or one element is reached, at which point the array is considered sorted. Quick Sort is much faster than Bubble Sort for large datasets, typically operating with an average time complexity of O(n log n).
